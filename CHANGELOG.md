# Changelog

All notable changes to Ordinate are documented here. Format based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versioning per
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

> **Note:** the project was renamed from **Screenchart** to **Ordinate**. Releases up to and
> including 0.1.0 shipped under the Screenchart name; entries below use the current name.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Visuals is a gallery.** Saved visuals are cards showing the chart type, name and last-updated
  time, instead of a list of rows. Each card has a star and a `⋯` menu: Open, Rename, Duplicate,
  Add to analysis, Export, Delete.
- **Favourite a visual** to pin it to the front of the gallery.
- **Export a single visual** on its own — PDF, PPTX, DOCX, HTML or PNG — through the same export
  dialog the capture result surface uses, carrying the styling the builder saved.
- **Add a visual straight to an analysis** from its card, into an existing analysis or a new one,
  without leaving the gallery.
- **"+ New visual" asks first**: which dataset, then whether to describe what you want or open the
  builder yourself.
- **The AI proposes several charts and draws them**, so you pick from real charts instead of
  accepting one sight-unseen. Every figure on screen is computed by the app from your data — the
  model contributes the structure and a short caption, and never a number. Nothing is saved for
  you: picking one opens the builder, and you still review and save it.

### Changed
- Renamed the project from Screenchart to Ordinate. Screenchart is now the name of one data source
  (screenshot capture) rather than the product. The application bundle and `userData` directory are
  unchanged pending a migration.
- The AI chart suggestion may now propose any of the 25 chart types the app can draw, up from seven.

### Fixed
- First-run capture no longer shows a redundant "Capture failed" card window before macOS
  Screen Recording permission is granted.
- Multi-step modal dialogs no longer let the keyboard focus trap land on a control in a hidden step,
  which stranded focus outside the dialog.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-XX <!-- TODO(ashish): set release date -->

Initial public release.

### Added
- Global-hotkey capture (default ⌘⌥S, user-configurable): drag a box around any chart, table,
  or on-screen data from any app.
- Plain-English AI analysis of the captured region.
- Visualizations rendered from the captured data.
- Bring-your-own-key providers: Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, and gateway (any OpenAI-compatible
  endpoint, e.g. OpenRouter / Ollama / custom).
- Local CLI-agent execution path as an alternative to BYOK.
- Local capture history (`userData/history/<threadId>/`).
- Map visualizations (tiles fetched from OpenStreetMap on render).
- macOS build (packaged with electron-builder).

### Known issues
- Unsigned build → macOS Gatekeeper shows "Apple could not verify" on first launch (see
  QUICKSTART for the dismissal steps).
- Some CLI agents (e.g. Cursor) trigger a macOS Automation prompt that is safe to deny.
- API keys are stored in plaintext on disk (not encrypted) — see PRIVACY.md.
