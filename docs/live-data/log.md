Measurements and decisions per task of [00-plan.md](00-plan.md). Newest last.

## 2026-10-09 — L1.1 Room for warehouse keys, L1.2 Snowflake (+ the Snowflake halves of L1.4, L1.5)

**Built.** `src/connectors/snowflake.ts` (the family: fields, the SQL API protocol, run, listTables,
describeTable, `live.runBound`), split by job into `snowflakeAuth.ts` (account → host, JWT, the JWT
cache), `snowflakeShape.ts` (rowType → ColumnType, value decoding), `snowflakeSql.ts` (the F3 cap,
bindings) and `snowflakeHttp.ts` (the socket). Registered in `FAMILY_MODULES`; logo `siSnowflake`.
`incrementalSql.ts` gains the `snowflake` dialect. Web: `SecretTextarea`, the masked multi-line
secret control (new-connection form, and the rail's "Key saved" → Replace).

**Decisions (and where they depart from the plan's wording).**

- **One secret field for the key or the PAT** (`token`, a textarea), not two. Both would land in the
  same `token` slot (`connectionSecrets.ts`: everything but `password` shares it, first writer wins),
  and `secretStatus` would show both as "Set" when only one is. The `auth` select says which it is; a
  PEM in PAT mode is refused before a socket opens, so a private key can never go out as a bearer.
- **FIXED wider than 15 digits is not declared a number.** Snowflake's `INTEGER` is `NUMBER(38,0)`:
  "precision > 15 → text" would make every integer column unsummable, and "→ number" would turn a
  20-digit id into null (parse.ts refuses a lossy number). It is left undeclared, so parse.ts decides
  from the values, as for a CSV or a Postgres `bigint`: a 16+ digit id keeps the column text
  (`test-connectorsSnowflake`: `ORDER_ID` → text), small values make it a number (`ID` → number).
- **REAL for an extract is printed at 15 significant digits** (DBL_DIG; Postgres's default before
  v12), because `0.30000000000000004` would otherwise be nulled by parse.ts's strict rule. `runBound`
  (live) keeps the exact double.
- **DATE / TIMESTAMP_NTZ bindings use the API's documented value formats**, epoch milliseconds and
  epoch nanoseconds, converted from the ISO string a `LiveParam` carries, rather than the ISO string
  itself. The session runs with `TIMEZONE = 'UTC'`.
- **A transport of its own over `safeFetch`, not `httpRequest`.** The SQL API gzips result partitions
  after the first; `httpRequest` decodes every body as UTF-8 text, which destroys gzip bytes, and has no
  abort signal. `http.ts` cannot grow, so `snowflakeHttp.ts` (111 lines) adds the clock, the byte
  ceiling, bounded gunzip and the signal over the same SSRF guard.
- **Sync submit, cancel when the handle lands.** The submit is sent without `async=true`, as the
  plan says. A submit still in flight when the caller gives up has no handle yet, so the caller is
  answered at once, and the statement is cancelled as soon as its 202 arrives. The statement's own
  `timeout` stops it on Snowflake's side in any case.
- **Test connection warnings.** `ConnectorTables` gains an optional `warnings` (a compatible change to
  `types.ts`), which `connectionRun` passes through and `connection:testAndSave` /
  `connection:listTables` / `connection:replaceSecret` return. The one sentence so far
  (`adminRoleWarning`) is in `src/connectors/connectorMessages.ts`, a new `MAIN_FILES` sentence file.

**Measured** (4 vCPU container, Node 22, medians):

| What | Result |
|---|---|
| Key-pair JWT, 2048-bit key, AES-256-CBC PKCS#8: sign (decrypt + sign) / cache hit | 1.43 ms / 0.006 ms (21 runs) |
| Shaping 100k values of one type (`shapeFirst`, extract) | FIXED 17–33 ms, TEXT 14.5, REAL 110, DATE 156, TIMESTAMP_TZ 158, TIMESTAMP_NTZ 181 |
| Gzip bomb (64 MB of zeros, 64 KB on the wire) against a 1 MB ceiling | stopped, reported truncated, in < 3 s |

Timestamp shaping costs what `toISOString()` costs, which the Postgres path already pays per cell in
`connectionRun` (a `Date` → ISO string). Removing BigInt from the epoch arithmetic changed nothing
measurable (626 → 678 ms for 100k × 8 columns, within noise), so the cost is the formatting.

**Tests.** `test-connectorsSnowflake` (88 checks: the account guard with 2,000 fuzzed inputs and a
negative control, request/JWT/QUERY_TAG, `crypto.verify` of the JWT, the JWT cache per org, every
binding type, 13 adversarial literals, every rowType incl. TZ offsets and U+FEFF, partitions,
truncation at the cap, 202 polling, cancel on abort in a poll and mid-submit, cancel on timeout,
listTables/describeTable, and the secret canary over every result, error, request and printed line),
`test-connectorsSnowflakeHttp` (9: SSRF refusal with a negative control, redirect refused, gzip,
gzip bomb, byte ceiling, timeout and abort tear the socket down), `test-incrementalRefresh` §8 (the
cursor predicate pushed to a fake SQL API through a real refresh), `test-connections-server` (the key
and passphrase through `testAndSave` into the encrypted store, `secretSet` booleans only, the
admin-role warning, and the existing dump/disk/reply/log greps extended to the new canaries),
Vitest for the masked control and the rail's Replace, and the connections e2e.

**Not done here.** BigQuery (L1.3, a sibling task). The real-account nightly
(`test-warehouseLive`, `warehouse-nightly.yml`) and the README / CLAUDE.md counts belong to the
reconciliation after both connectors merge.
